Bugs

* Bug where ships can fly between different galaxies without connecting trade route
* Investigate: - When clicking to move ships, and somehow the cursor isn't set properly (crosshair set by default rather than only when moving planets). Disables the move ships button. Stack trace is as follows: 
    NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object

* When switching between views, ensure that ship display is toggled off.
    - Select planet with ships. Toggle display on. Switch to planet without ships. Display still visible, and untogglable off.
* When there is a large amount of entries in a scroll list, clicking down to drag triggers the movement of the camera
* Cycle was possible within galaxy - formed triangle with three planets
* When the number of planets is too great, the name generator fails (since it doesn't take into account the number of planets needed)
* Move ships de-re



Features
========
* Fleets need to specify an allegiance - currently color, replace with allegiance class
* Introduce the concept of different types of ships
* Ability to cancel ship movement at end of turn (in case of enemy fleet appears)
    - Possibly introduce undo?
* Add ability to limit distance of ships
    - Figure out how to deal with slower ships - should be handled (address when different types of ships are present)
* Figure out how to deal with situation where two fleets are travelling together - need method of combining them together
* Ability to select which fleet you want to move when there are multiple on the planet
* Randomly generated textures on the planets - add different biomes
* Different biomes need to have differing results on the planets
* Unit tests
* Battles between differing allegiances
* Movements between galaxies
    - Should have multiple entry points for how close they are to relative galaxies ?
    - Add a random component for the amount of entry points between them
* Move galaxies at random
* Untangle trade routes and move into random pattern
* Need to be able to move fleets to other galaxies (scroll to side of screen for movement ?)
* Limit camera view to only what is available (or wrap around)
* Refactor fleets within planets code away into separate class - too available, too many public methods
* Prevent ships from being created when occupied by foreign ship (or immediately engage in combat?)
* Add ownership concept - players not on the same team cannot move the ships that do not belong to them. 
* Address TODO within codebase
