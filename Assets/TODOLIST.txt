* Bug where ships can fly between different galaxies without connecting trade route
* Investigate: - When clicking to move ships, and somehow the cursor isn't set properly (crosshair set by default rather than only when moving planets). Disables the move ships button. Stack trace is as follows: 
    NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object

* When there is a large amount of entries in a scroll list (i.e. fleet listing), clicking down to drag triggers the movement of the camera
* Cycle was possible within galaxy - formed triangle with three planets
* When the number of planets is too great, the name generator fails (since it doesn't take into account the number of planets needed)
* Screen moves away when trying to end turn - need to figure out some way of detecting when the mouse is heading towards the outside (end turn button or closing the planet menu)
* Adding a large amount of ships to the fleet display performs poorly (especially opening and closing) - possibly better to shift the entries over and hide them rather than deleting them
* Sometimes planets will appear on-top of each other. Need to prevent that (add a minimum distance that planets need to span?)
* Sometimes planets will spawn atop trade route, but doesn't find edge
    - Delete galaxies that have edges crossing / planets on trade route
* Getting transform infinity errors or NaN when attempting to set the planet position in force directed graph. Both occurred 50 times...
    transform.position assign attempt for 'Planet(Clone)' is not valid. Input position is { NaN, NaN, NaN }.

Features
========
* Fleets need to specify an allegiance - currently color, replace with allegiance class
* Ability to cancel ship movement at end of turn (in case of enemy fleet appears)
    - Possibly introduce undo?
* Figure out how to deal with situation where two fleets are travelling together - need method of combining them together
* Ability to select which fleet you want to move when there are multiple on the planet
* Randomly generated textures on the planets - add different biomes
* Different biomes need to have differing results on the planets
* Unit tests
* Battles between differing allegiances - should be more advanced than just 'my number is greater than yours'
* Movements between galaxies
    - Should have multiple entry points for how close they are to relative galaxies ?
    - Add a random component for the amount of entry points between them
* Move galaxies at random
* Limit camera view to only what is available (or wrap around)
* Add HOME button to return to the center of the galaxy
* Add increase of speed when moving mouse closer to the side of the screen
* Refactor fleets within planets code away into separate class - too available, too many public methods
    - Clean up galaxy code as well - too large
* Prevent ships from being created when occupied by foreign ship (or immediately engage in combat?)
* Add ownership concept - players not on the same team cannot move the ships that do not belong to them. 
* Address TODO within codebase
* Add bounding boxes around galaxies - ensure that they don't collide (possibly use force directed graphes on them)
