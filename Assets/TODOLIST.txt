Bugs
====
* Bug where ships can fly between different galaxies without connecting trade route
* Investigate: - When clicking to move ships, and somehow the cursor isn't set properly (crosshair set by default rather than only when moving planets). Disables the move ships button. Stack trace is as follows: 
    NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object
